# Agents

Use these roles when delegating work:

- **frontend-dev**: implement UI/features following repo conventions.
- **reviewer**: strict code review: correctness, DX, perf, security, simplicity.
- **qa**: write tests, find edge cases, propose test matrix.
- **product**: clarify requirements, define acceptance criteria, UX expectations.

Rule:

- For any non-trivial feature: run reviewer + qa passes before finalizing.
