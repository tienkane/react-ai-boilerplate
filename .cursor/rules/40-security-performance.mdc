description: Security + performance baseline
globs: ["**/*"]

Security:

- Never commit secrets.
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless sanitized and approved.
- Validate untrusted input at boundaries.

Performance:

- Do not prematurely optimize.
- Use memo/useCallback only when there's a measured or obvious need.
