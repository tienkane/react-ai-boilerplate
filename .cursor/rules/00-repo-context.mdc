# Repository Context

You are working in a personal React project with TypeScript.

## Priority Hierarchy

When making decisions, follow this order:

1. **Correctness** — Does it work? Does it handle edge cases?
2. **Simplicity** — Is this the simplest solution that works?
3. **Consistency** — Does it match existing patterns in the codebase?
4. **Type-safety** — Are types correct and meaningful?
5. **UX polish** — Does it handle loading/error/empty states?

## Default Assumptions

Unless the codebase explicitly shows otherwise:

- TypeScript is required (no `.js` files)
- Avoid adding new dependencies
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Follow existing code patterns, even if you'd do it differently
- One logical change per commit

## Before You Write Code

1. **Scan related files** — Understand existing patterns
2. **Check for similar implementations** — Follow established conventions
3. **Identify the minimal change** — Don't refactor beyond scope

## Change Scope Rules

✅ **DO:**

- Touch only files necessary for the task
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Match existing code style
- Add types for new code

❌ **DON'T:**

- Refactor unrelated code
- "Improve" existing code outside scope
- Add dependencies without explicit approval
- Change file organization without asking

## Output Expectations

Every response should be:

- **Reviewable** — Clear enough for a human to review
- **Explainable** — You can justify every change
- **Minimal** — No unnecessary changes
- **Complete** — Handles edge cases and errors
