React rules:

- Prefer functional components + hooks.
- Split components when a file gets hard to scan (>200-300 lines).
- Keep state close to where it is used.
- Always handle: loading, empty, error states for async UI.
- Accessibility: buttons for actions, label inputs, keyboard-friendly.

Styling:

- Follow the project's existing styling system.
- Do not introduce a new styling library.
